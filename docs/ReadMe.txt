Thank you for using Snakefish SMS, titled SMS for VI!

Installation:
To install, simply put this file onto your 2.2 Android phone, (perhaps by SD card), and install.
Alternately, a 2.2 Android VM can run the program as well (in this case, DDMS can be used to send messages to the application).

Usage:
Please note that at any time, the menu button can be pressed to configure a limited set of options (currently, the buttons don't store these settings).
When using the Speech-to-text interface, the commands 'help' and 'list' can be used for some context based help.  The help given here is currently incomplete with respect to our features.
Finally, please note that we have a command keyword, 'snakefish', that may increase the reliability of offering commands to the software.  At the very least, this helps in notifying our program that at any given point in time, you are offering our program a command, not just various text.


Again, thank you for using Snakefish SMS!
