Plan 0: do 1 and 2 in that order, 3 and 4 are optional and are done together

Plan 2: steps 2-1 and 2-2 immediately halt the process, and doing one or the other is normal operation.  Step 2-3 is executed if steps 3 and 4 are to be done

Plan 3: steps 3-1 and 3-2 are optional, though doing so is recommended

Plan 4: steps 4-1 and 4-2 are optional, but one must be done to defer the message
