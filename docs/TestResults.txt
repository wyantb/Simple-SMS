  Voice:
    Ignore: 'ignore (message?)'
    Read message: 'read/reply to message'
    Send message: 'send|message send'
    Menu: 'settings'
    Compose new: '

  Is reply the same as read?  Tad confusing
  Can't see the divider between text messages
  Also, there is no divider between 'User' and the first message
  Confused conversation screen with inbox
    What else can we do to differentiate the two?
  What does read mean? (reply screen)
  'Oh, it means read what I wrote' -> moving buttons to bottom
  How can we differentiate the two better?
  The feedback for headphones and options is messed up

Other:
  Voice:
    'headphones' -> does auto-toggle
    'settings|options'

  Entering message: 'do i press the text?' figured out on his own
  Text entry: We have no need for multiline texts, enter should work differently
  Text entry: Confused by 'enter your text here'
  Text entry: Is that a text box?  Looks like the background.

Todd hasn't used Android before: wasn't an issue
Scrollable contacts list may be better than text entry box for recipient

Bug: text in box is black on black
